 * ejabberd extauth script for the integration with friendica
 *
 * Originally written for joomla by Dalibor Karlovic <dado@krizevci.info>
 * modified for Friendica by Michael Vogel <icarus@dabo.de>
 * published under GPL
 *
 * Latest version of the original script for joomla is available at:
 * http://87.230.15.86/~dado/ejabberd/joomla-login
 *
 * Installation:
 *
 * 	- Change it's owner to whichever user is running the server, ie. ejabberd
 * 	  $ chown ejabberd:ejabberd /path/to/friendica/bin/auth_ejabberd.php
 *
 * 	- Change the access mode so it is readable only to the user ejabberd and has exec
 * 	  $ chmod 700 /path/to/friendica/bin/auth_ejabberd.php
 *
 * 	- Edit your ejabberd.yml file and add after "shaper:":
 *
 * 	  auth_method: [external]
 * 	  extauth_program: "/path/to/friendica/bin/auth_ejabberd.php"
 *    auth_use_cache: false
 *
 * 	- Restart your ejabberd service, you should be able to login with your friendica auth info
 *
 * Other hints:
 * 	- if your users have a space or a @ in their nickname, they'll run into trouble
 * 	  registering with any client so they should be instructed to replace these chars
 * 	  " " (space) is replaced with "%20"
 * 	  "@" is replaced with "(a)"
 *
