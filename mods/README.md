## `sample-systemd.timer` and `sample-systemd.service`

Sample systemd unit files to start worker.php periodically.

Please place them in the correct location for your system, typically this is `/etc/systemd/system/friendicaworker.timer` and `/etc/systemd/system/friendicaworker.service`.
Please report problems and improvements to `!helpers@forum.friendi.ca` and `@utzer@social.yl.ms` or open an issue in [the GitHub Friendica page](https://github.com/friendica/friendica/issues).
This is for usage of systemd instead of cron to start the worker periodically, the solution is a work-in-progress and can surely be improved.
