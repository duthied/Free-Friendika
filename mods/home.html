		<h4>Is it hard to run Friendica?</h4>
		<p>No, not at all! You need a LAMP server, most shared hosting services that offer MySQL, PHP and the ability to run cron jobs will do just fine. If you have your own (virtual) server, for a small Friendica server something like a Raspberry2B is sufficient from the specs.</p>
