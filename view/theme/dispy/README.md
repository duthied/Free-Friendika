## Dispy Themes ##

**Dispy**: Light, Spartan, Sleek, and Functional

**Dispy Dark**: Dark, Spartan, Sleek, and Functional


### A Brief History ###

Their beginnings are unknown to me, but they are part of the themes
that Mike Macgirvin, Emmanual Revah, put together for Friendica, I *think*.

Later on, in the fall and winter of 2011-2012, I took over maintaining
the original dispy (now called dispy light). It went through a minor re-vamp,
keeping to its spartan look as much as possible.

I added more rounded corners, and as Friendica grew in capabilities and
features, so did it - but, I always wanted to keep the features down, so as
to be fast and spartan, which seems to appeal to a lot of the geekier
users (like myself).

Soon after I started maintaining dispy light, I developed its sister
theme - dark - according to another user's request (and other "+1"
votes for one like it). So *dark* was "born".

Anyway, I've added a few more things since, and I hope I haven't
over-done it ;-).
