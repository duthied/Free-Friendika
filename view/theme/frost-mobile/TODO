Photo album display?

- The "lock" icon for private items
	- change it to black?
	- when clicked, the popup window displays poorly

- Edit photo page: bottom buttons are off-center in Dolphin Mini

- Pager: looks weird when only "prev" is there

- BB code buttons for status updates

- Get "add contact" back on contacts page

- Admin: access to more pages than summary?

- Embedded video playback is way too big

- Needs to be faster!
	- Reduce DOM elements (~2400 for 10 items, ~8400 for 40 items)
	- Automatically set limit of 10 items for Network and Profile?
