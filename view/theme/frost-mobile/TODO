Photo album display?

- The "lock" icon for private items
	- change it to black?
	- when clicked, the popup window displays poorly

- Edit photo page: bottom buttons are off-center in Dolphin Mini

- BB code buttons for status updates

- Get "add contact" back on contacts page

- Admin: access to more pages than summary?

- Find a way to show embedded videos at the normal size for tablets that can handle it

- Need to find a way to deal with freakin annoying elements that don't respect screen width limits.
  Specifically, need to find a way to keep them from forcing a horizontal scroll bar to show up and
  making the rest of the body text overflow the item's borders that is screen-width sensitive (it's
  annoying to have a 300px truncated code block on a 1024px wide screen). At least the following cause problems:
	- code blocks
	- blockquote blocks
	- #reallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallylongtags

- Needs to be faster!
	- Reduce DOM elements (~2400 for 10 items, ~8400 for 40 items)


- Sometimes, when "Permission denied", wrong login page is shown
