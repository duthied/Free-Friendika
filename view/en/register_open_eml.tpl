Dear $[username],
	Thank you for registering at $[sitename]. Your account has been created. 
The login details are as follows:


Site Location:	$[siteurl]
Login Name:	$[email]
Password:	$[password]

You may change your password from your account "Settings" page after logging 
in.

Please take a few moments to review the other account settings on that page.

You may also wish to add some basic information to your default profile 
(on the "Profiles" page) so that other people can easily find you.

We recommend setting your full name, adding a profile photo,
adding some profile "keywords" (very useful in making new friends) - and 
perhaps what country you live in; if you do not wish to be more specific
than that.

We fully respect your right to privacy, and none of these items are necessary. 
If you are new and do not know anybody here, they may help
you to make some new and interesting friends.  


Thank you and welcome to $[sitename].

Sincerely,
	$[sitename] Administrator
