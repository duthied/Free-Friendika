Friendica Templating Documentation
==================================

* [Home](help)

Friendica uses [Smarty 3](http://www.smarty.net/) as PHP templating engine.
The main templates are found in

		/view/templates

theme authors may overwrite the default templates by putting a files with the same name into the

		/view/themes/$themename/templates

directory.

Templates that are only used by addons shall be placed in the

		/addon/$addonname/templates

directory.

To render a template use the function *getMarkupTemplate* to load the template and *replaceMacros* to replace the macros/variables in the just loaded template file.

		$tpl = Renderer::getMarkupTemplate('install_settings.tpl');
        $o .= Renderer::replaceMacros($tpl, array( ... ));

the array consists of an association of an identifier and the value for that identifier, i.e.

		'$title' => $install_title,

where the value may as well be an array by its own.

Form Templates
--------------

To guarantee a consistent look and feel for input forms, i.e. in the settings sections, there are templates for the basic form fields.
They are initialized with an array of data, depending on the tyle of the field.

All of these take an array holding the values, e.g. for a one line text input field, which is required and should be used to type email addresses use something along the lines of:

		'$adminmail' => array('adminmail', DI::l10n()->t('Site administrator email address'), $adminmail, DI::l10n()->t('Your account email address must match this in order to use the web admin panel.'), 'required', '', 'email'),

To evaluate the input value, you can then use the $_POST array, more precisely the $_POST['adminemail'] variable.

Listed below are the template file names, the general purpose of the template and their field parameters.
