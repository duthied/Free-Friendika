Channels
=====

* [Home](help)

Channels are a way to discover new content or to display content that you might have missed otherwise.
There are several predefined channels, additionally you can create your own channels, based on some rules.
Channels only display posts from the last 24 hours (this value can be changed by the admin).

In the display settings in the section "Timelines" you can define which channels and other timelines you want to see in the "Channels" widget on the network page and which channels should appear in the menu bar at the top of the page.

Also in the display settings in the section "Channels" you can define all the languages that you want to see in your channels. Here you can select more than one language.

On the contact page you can define the channel frequency for every contact. The options are:

* Default frequency: Posts by this contact are displayed in the "for you" channel if you interact often with this contact or if a post reached some level of interaction.
* Display all posts of this contact: All posts from this contact will appear on the "for you" channel.
* Display only few posts: When a contact creates a lot of posts in a short period, this setting reduces the number of displayed posts in every channel.
* Never display posts: Posts from this contact will never be displayed in any channel.
