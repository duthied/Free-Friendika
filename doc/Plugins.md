Friendica Addon/Plugin development
==========================

Please see the sample addon 'randplace' for a working example of using some of these features. The facebook addon provides an example of integrating both "addon" and "module" functionality. Addons work by intercepting event hooks - which must be registered. Modules work by intercepting specific page requests (by URL path). 


Plugin names cannot contain spaces or other punctuation and are used as filenames and function names. You may supply a "friendly" name within the comment block. Each addon must contain both an install and an uninstall function based on the addon/plugin name. For instance "plugin1name_install()". These two functions take no arguments and are usually responsible for registering (and unregistering) event hooks that your plugin will require. The install and uninstall functions will also be called (i.e. re-installed) if the plugin changes after installation - therefore your uninstall should not destroy data and install should consider that data may already exist. Future extensions may provide for "setup" amd "remove". 

Plugins should contain a comment block with the four following parameters: 

	/*
	* Name: My Great Plugin 
 	* Description: This is what my plugin does. It's really cool
 	* Version: 1.0
 	* Author: John Q. Public <john@myfriendicasite.com>
	*/




Register your plugin hooks during installation.

    register_hook($hookname, $file, $function);

$hookname is a string and corresponds to a known Friendica hook.

$file is a pathname relative to the top-level Friendica directory. This *should* be 'addon/plugin_name/plugin_name.php' in most cases.

$function is a string and is the name of the function which will be executed when the hook is called.


Your hook callback functions will be called with at least one and possibly two arguments


    function myhook_function(&$a, &$b) {


    }


If you wish to make changes to the calling data, you must declare them as
reference variables (with '&') during function declaration.

$a is the Friendica 'App' class - which contains a wealth of information
about the current state of Friendica, such as which module has been called,
configuration info, the page contents at the point the hook was invoked, profile
and user information, etc. It is recommeded you call this '$a' to match its usage
elsewhere.

$b can be called anything you like. This is information which is specific to the hook
currently being processed, and generally contains information that is being immediately
processed or acted on that you can use, display, or alter. Remember to declare it with
'&' if you wish to alter it.

Modules
--------

Plugins/addons may also act as "modules" and intercept all page requests for a given URL path. In order for a plugin to act as a module it needs to define a function "plugin_name_module()" which takes no arguments and need not do anything.

If this function exists, you will now receive all page requests for "http://my.web.site/plugin_name" - with any number of URL components as additional arguments. These are parsed into an array $a->argv, with a corresponding $a->argc indicating the number of URL components. So http://my.web.site/plugin/arg1/arg2 would look for a module named "plugin" and pass its module functions the $a App structure (which is available to many components). This will include:
     $a->argc = 3
     $a->argv = array(0 => 'plugin', 1 => 'arg1', 2 => 'arg2');

Your module functions will often contain the function plugin_name_content(&$a), which defines and returns the page body content. They may also contain plugin_name_post(&$a) which is called before the _content function and typically handles the results of POST forms. You may also have plugin_name_init(&$a) which is called very early on and often does module initialisation. 


Templates
----------

If your plugin need some template, you can use Friendica template system. Friendica use [smarty3](http://www.smarty.net/) as template engine.

Put your tpl files in *templates/* subfolder of your plugin.

In your code, like in function plugin_name_content(), load template file and execute it passing needed values:

    # load template file. first argument is the template name, 
    # second is the plugin path relative to friendica top folder
    $tpl = get_markup_template('mytemplate.tpl', 'addon/plugin_name/');

    # apply template. first argument is the loaded template, 
    # second an array of 'name'=>'values' to pass to template
    $output = replace_macros($tpl,array(
        'title' => 'My beautifull plugin',
    ));
