First things first, let's make sure you're logged in to your account.
If you're not already logged in, do so in the frame below.

Once you've logged in (or if you are already logged in), you'll now be looking at your profile page.

This is a bit like a Facebook wall.
It's where all your status messages are kept, and where your friends come to post on your wall.

To write your status, simply click on the Pencil & Paper icon in the top right (in the Frio theme), or click in the box that says "share" (other themes).
When you do this, the posting dialog box will appear or the share box will expand.

You can see some formatting options such as Bold, Italics and Underline, as well as ways to add links, pictures (dependent on the theme), and a paperclip icon to attach or embed content.
You can use these to upload pictures and files from your computer, share websites with a bit of preview text, or embed video and audio files from elsewhere on the web.
With the Frio theme, the browser tab can be used to upload and post media from your account.
You can also set your post location here.

Once you've finished writing your post, click on the padlock icon or permissions tab to select who can see it.
If you do not change anything, your post will be public.
This means it will appear to anybody who views your profile, and in the community tab if your site has it enabled, as well as in the network tab of any of your contacts.

Play around with this a bit, then when you're ready to move on, we'll take a look at the <a href="help/Quick-Start-network">Network Tab</a>
