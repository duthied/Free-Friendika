How to move your account between servers
============

* [Home](help)


! **This is an experimental feature**

* Go to "Settings" -> "[Export personal data](uexport)"
* Click on "Export account" to save your account data.
* **Save the file in a secure place!** It contains your details, your contacts, groups, and personal settings. It also contains your secret keys to authenticate yourself to your contacts.
* Go to your new server, and open *http://newserver.com/uimport* (there is not a direct link to this page at the moment).
* Do NOT create a new account prior to importing your old settings - uimport should be used *instead* of register.
* Load your saved account file and click "Import".
* After the move, the account on the old server will not work reliably anymore, and should be not used.


Friendica contacts
---
Friendica will recreate your account on the new server, with your contacts and groups.
A message is sent to Friendica contacts, to inform them about your move:
If your contacts are runnning on an updated server, your details on their side will be automatically updated.

GNU Social/Diaspora contacts
---
Contacts on GNU Social or Diaspora will be archived, as we can't inform them about your move.
You should ask them to remove your contact from their lists and re-add you, and you should do the same with their contact.
