Friendica Addon development
==============

* [Home](help)

Please see the sample addon 'randplace' for a working example of using some of these features.
Addons work by intercepting event hooks - which must be registered.
Modules work by intercepting specific page requests (by URL path).

## Naming

Addon names are used in file paths and functions names, and as such:
- Can't contain spaces or punctuation.
- Can't start with a number.

## Metadata

You can provide human-readable information about your addon in the first multi-line comment of your addon file.

Here's the structure:

```php
/**
 * Name: {Human-readable name}
 * Description: {Short description}
 * Version: 1.0
 * Author: {Author1 Name}
 * Author: {Author2 Name} <{Author profile link}>
 * Maintainer: {Maintainer1 Name}
 * Maintainer: {Maintainer2 Name} <{Maintainer profile link}>
 * Status: {Unsupported|Arbitrary status}
 */
```

You can also provide a longer documentation in a `README` or `README.md` file.
The latter will be converted from Markdown to HTML in the addon detail page.

## Install/Uninstall

If your addon uses hooks, they have to be registered in a `<addon>_install()` function.
This function also allows to perform arbitrary actions your addon needs to function properly.

Uninstalling an addon automatically unregisters any hook it registered, but if you need to provide specific uninstallation steps, you can add them in a `<addon>_uninstall()` function.

The install and uninstall functions will be called (i.e. re-installed) if the addon changes after installation.
Therefore your uninstall should not destroy data and install should consider that data may already exist.
Future extensions may provide for "setup" and "remove".

## PHP addon hooks

Register your addon hooks during installation.

    \Friendica\Core\Hook::register($hookname, $file, $function);

`$hookname` is a string and corresponds to a known Friendica PHP hook.

`$file` is a pathname relative to the top-level Friendica directory.
This *should* be 'addon/*addon_name*/*addon_name*.php' in most cases and can be shortened to `__FILE__`.

`$function` is a string and is the name of the function which will be executed when the hook is called.

### Arguments
Your hook callback functions will be called with at most one argument

    function <addon>_<hookname>(&$b) {

    }

If you wish to make changes to the calling data, you must declare them as reference variables (with `&`) during function declaration.

#### $b
$b can be called anything you like.
This is information specific to the hook currently being processed, and generally contains information that is being immediately processed or acted on that you can use, display, or alter.
Remember to declare it with `&` if you wish to alter it.

## Admin settings

Your addon can provide user-specific settings via the `addon_settings` PHP hook, but it can also provide node-wide settings in the administration page of your addon.

Simply declare a `<addon>_addon_admin()` function to display the form and a `<addon>_addon_admin_post()` function to process the data from the form.0

## Global stylesheets

If your addon requires adding a stylesheet on all pages of Friendica, add the following hook:

```php
function <addon>_install()
{
	\Friendica\Core\Hook::register('head', __FILE__, '<addon>_head');
	...
}


function <addon>_head()
{
	\Friendica\DI::page()->registerStylesheet(__DIR__ . '/relative/path/to/addon/stylesheet.css');
}
```

`__DIR__` is the folder path of your addon.

## JavaScript

### Global scripts

If your addon requires adding a script on all pages of Friendica, add the following hook:


```php
function <addon>_install()
{
	\Friendica\Core\Hook::register('footer', __FILE__, '<addon>_footer');
	...
}

function <addon>_footer()
{
	\Friendica\DI::page()->registerFooterScript(__DIR__ . '/relative/path/to/addon/script.js');
}
```

`__DIR__` is the folder path of your addon.

### JavaScript hooks

The main Friendica script provides hooks via events dispatched on the `document` property.
In your JavaScript file included as described above, add your event listener like this:

```js
document.addEventListener(name, callback);
```

- *name* is the name of the hook and corresponds to a known Friendica JavaScript hook.
- *callback* is a JavaScript anonymous function to execute.

More info about JavaScript event listeners: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener

#### Current JavaScript hooks

##### postprocess_liveupdate
Called at the end of the live update process (XmlHttpRequest) and on a post preview.
No additional data is provided.

## Modules

Addons may also act as "modules" and intercept all page requests for a given URL path.
In order for a addon to act as a module it needs to declare an empty function `<addon>_module()`.

If this function exists, you will now receive all page requests for `https://my.web.site/<addon>` - with any number of URL components as additional arguments.
These are parsed into the `App\Arguments` object.
So `https://my.web.site/addon/arg1/arg2` would give this:
```php
DI::args()->getArgc(); // = 3
DI::args()->get(0); // = 'addon'
DI::args()->get(1); // = 'arg1'
DI::args()->get(2); // = 'arg2'
```

To display a module page, you need to declare the function `<addon>_content()`, which defines and returns the page body content.
They may also contain `<addon>_post()` which is called before the `<addon>_content` function and typically handles the results of POST forms.
You may also have `<addon>_init()` which is called before `<addon>_content` and should include common logic to your module.

## Templates

If your addon needs some template, you can use the Friendica template system.
Friendica uses [smarty3](http://www.smarty.net/) as a template engine.

Put your tpl files in the *templates/* subfolder of your addon.

In your code, like in the function addon_name_content(), load the template file and execute it passing needed values:

```php
use Friendica\Core\Renderer;

# load template file. first argument is the template name,
# second is the addon path relative to friendica top folder
$tpl = Renderer::getMarkupTemplate('mytemplate.tpl', __DIR__);

# apply template. first argument is the loaded template,
# second an array of 'name' => 'values' to pass to template
$output = Renderer::replaceMacros($tpl, array(
	'title' => 'My beautiful addon',
));
```
