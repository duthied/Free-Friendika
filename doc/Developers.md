Friendica Developer Guide
===================

**Here is how you can join us.**

First, get yourself a working git package on the system where you will be
doing development.

Create your own github account.

You may fork/clone the Friendica repository from [https://github.com/friendica/friendica.git](https://github.com/friendica/friendica.git).

Follow the instructions provided here: [http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/)
to create and use your own tracking fork on github

Then go to your github page and create a "Pull request" when you are ready
to notify us to merge your work.

**Important**

Please pull in any changes from the project repository and merge them with your work **before** issuing a pull request. We reserve the right to reject any patch which results in a large number of merge conflicts. This is especially true in the case of language translations - where we may not be able to understand the subtle differences between conflicting versions.

Also - **test your changes**. Don't assume that a simple fix won't break something else. If possible get an experienced Friendica developer to review the code.
