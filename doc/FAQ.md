**Why do I getting warnings about certificates?**

Sometimes you get a browser warning about a missing certificate. These warnings can have three reasons: 

1. the server you are connected to doesn't have SSL; 

2. the server has a self-signed certificate (not recommended)

3. the certificate is expired. 

*(SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is a technology to encrypt data as it passes between two computers).* 

If you dont have a SSL cert yet, there are three ways to get one: buy one, get a free one (eg. via StartSSL) or create your own (not recommended). [You can find more information about setting up SSL and why it's a bad idea to use self-signed SSL here.](help/SSL) 

Be aware that a browser warning about security issues is something that can make new users feel insecure about the whole friendica project. 

Also you can have problems with the connection to diaspora because some pods require a SSL-certificated connection. 

If you are just using friendica for a specified group of people on a single server without a connection to the rest of the friendica network, there is no need to use SSL. If you exclusively use public posts, there is also no need for it. 

If you havn't set up a server yet, it's wise to compare the different provider and their SSL conditions. Some allow the usage of free certificates or give you the access to their certificate for free. Other ones only allow bought certificates from themselves or other providers.

<a name="upload"></a>

**How can I upload images, files, links, videos and sound files to posts?**

You can upload images from your computer by using the [editor](help/Text_editor). An overview of all uploaded images is listed at <i>yourpage.com/photos/profilename</i>. There you could also upload images directly and choose, if your contacts shall receive a message about this upload.

Generally, you could attach every kind of file to a post. This is possible by using the "paper-clip"-symbol at the editor. These files will be linked to your post and can be downloaded by your contacts. But it's not possible to get a preview for these ones. Because of this, this upload method is recommended for office or zipped files. 
If you want to use Dropbox, owncloud at your own server or any other [filehoster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_hosting_services), you'll have use the "link"-button (chain-symbol). 

When you're adding URLs of other webpages with the "link"-button, Friendica tries to create a small preview. If this doesn't work, try to add the link by typing: [url=http://example.com]<i>self-chosen name</i>[/url].

You can also add video and audio files to posts. But instead of a direct upload you have to use one of the following methods:

1. Add the video or audio link of a hoster (Youtube, Vimeo, Soundcloud and everyone else with oembed/opengraph-support). Videos will be shown with a preview image you can click on to start it. SoundCloud directly inserts a player to your post. 

2. If you have an own server, you can upload your multimedia files via FTP and insert the URL. Your video or sound file will be shown with their own player at your post. 

Friendica is using HTML5 for embedding content. Therefore, the supported files are depending on your browser and operating system (OS). Some filetypes are WebM, MP4, MP3 and OGG. There are more examples at wikipedia ([video](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video), [audio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_audio)).

<a name="avatars"></a>

**Is it possible to have different avatars per profile?**

Yes. On your Edit/Manage Profiles page, you will find a "change profile photo" link. Clicking this will take you to a page where you can upload a photograph and select which profile it will be associated with. To avoid privacy leakage, we only display the photograph associated with your default profile as the avatar in your posts.

<a name="contacts"></a>

**What is the difference between blocked|ignored|archived|hidden contacts?**

We prevent direct communication with blocked contacts. They are not included in delivery, and their own posts to you are not imported; however their conversations with your friends will still be visible in your stream. If you remove a contact completely, they can send you another friend request. Blocked contacts cannot do this. They cannot communicate with you directly, only through friends.

Ignored contacts are included in delivery - they will receive your posts. However we do not import their posts to you. Like blocking, you will still see this person's comments to posts made by your friends.

[A plugin called "blockem" can be installed to collapse/hide all posts from a particular person in your stream if you desire complete blocking of an individual, including his/her conversations with your other friends.]

An archived contact means that communication is not possible and will not be attempted (perhaps the person moved to a new site and removed the old profile); however unlike blocking, existing posts this person made before being archived will be visible in your stream.

A hidden contact will not be displayed in any "friend list" (except to you). However a hidden contact will appear normally in conversations and this may expose his/her hidden status to anybody who can see the conversation.

<a name="removed"></a>

**What happens when an account is removed? Is it truly deleted?**

If you delete your account, we will immediately remove all your content on your server, and then issue requests to all your contacts to remove you. This will also remove you from the global directory. Doing this requires that your account and profile still be "partially" available for up to 24 hours in order to establish contact with all your friends. We can block it in several ways so that it appears empty and all profile information erased, but will then wait for 24 hours (or after all of your contacts have been notified) before we can physically remove it.

<a name="hashtag"></a>

**Can I follow a hashtag?**

No. The act of 'following' a hashtags is an interesting technology, but presents a few issues.

1.) Posts which have to be copied to all sites on the network that are "listening" to that tag, which increases the storage demands to the detriment of small sites, and making the use of shared hosting practically impossible, and

2.) Making spam easy (tag spam is quite a serious issue on identi.ca for instance)

but mostly

3.) It creates a natural bias towards large sites which hold more tagged content - if your network uses tagging instead of other conversation federation mechanisms such as groups/forums.

Instead, we offer other mechanisms for wide-area conversations while retaining a 'level playing ground' for both large and small sites, such as forums and community pages and shared tags.

<a name="rss"></a>

**How to create a RSS feed of the stream?**

If you want to share your public page via rss you can use one of the following links:

RSS feed of your posts

	basic-url.com/**dfrn_poll/profilename  

	Example: Friendica Support 
	
	https://helpers.pyxis.uberspace.de/dfrn_poll/helpers

RSS feed of the conversations at your site

	basic-url.com/dfrn_poll/profilename/converse
	
	Example: Friendica Support 
	
	https://helpers.pyxis.uberspace.de/dfrn_poll/helpers/converse

<a name="clients"></a>

**Are there any clients for friendica I can use?**

Friendica is using a [Twitter/StatusNet compatible API](help/api), which means you can use any Twitter/StatusNet/GNU Social client for your plattform as long as you can change the API path in its settings. Here is a list of known working clients

* Android
  * Friendica Client for Android
  * AndStatus
  * Twidere
  * Mustard and Mustard-Mod
* Linux
  * Hotot
  * Choqok
* MacOS X
  * Hotot
* Windows
  * Hotot

Depending on the features of the client you might encounter some glitches in usability, like being limited in the length of your postings to 140 characters and having no access to the [permission settings](help/Groups-and-Privacy).

**Where I can find help?**

If you have problems with your Friendica page, you can ask the community at the [Friendica Support Group](https://helpers.pyxis.uberspace.de/profile/helpers). If you can't use your default profile you can either use a test account [test server](http://friendica.com/node/31) respectively an account at a public site [list](http://dir.friendica.com/siteinfo) or you can use the Librelist mailing list. If you want to use the mailing list, please just send a mail to friendica AT librelist DOT com.

If you are a theme developer, you will find help at this forum: [Friendica Theme Developers](https://friendica.eu/profile/ftdevs).
