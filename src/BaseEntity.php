/**
 * The Entity classes directly inheriting from this abstract class are meant to represent a single business entity.
 * Their properties may or may not correspond with the database fields of the table we use to represent it.
 * Each model method must correspond to a business action being performed on this entity.
 * Only these methods will be allowed to alter the model data.
 *
 * To persist such a model, the associated Repository must be instantiated and the "save" method must be called
 * and passed the entity as a parameter.
 *
 * Ideally, the constructor should only be called in the associated Factory which will instantiate entities depending
 * on the provided data.
 *
 * Since these objects aren't meant to be using any dependency, including logging, unit tests can and must be
 * written for each and all of their methods
