## Friendica\Factory

This namespace contains Factories.
A Factory is used to create specific objects based on its configuration.

See [Factory Method](https://designpatternsphp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Creational/FactoryMethod/README.html)

Use the classes inside this directory if you want to change the way how new objects should get created.
Don't use the classes to change the behaviour of the concrete objects.
