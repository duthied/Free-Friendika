/**
 * When I installed docblox, I had the experience that it does not generate any output at all.
 * This script may be used to find that kind of problems with the documentation build process.
 * If docblox generates output, use another approach for debugging.
 *
 * Basically, docblox takes a list of files to build documentation from. This script assumes there is a file or set of files
 * breaking the build when it is included in that list. It tries to calculate the smallest list containing these files.
 * Unfortunatly, the original problem is NP-complete, so what the script does is a best guess only.
 *
 * So it starts with a list of all files in the project.
 * If that list can't be build, it cuts it in two parts and tries both parts independently. If only one of them breaks,
 * it takes that one and tries the same independently. If both break, it assumes this is the smallest set. This assumption
 * is not necessarily true. Maybe the smallest set consists of two files and both of them were in different parts when
 * the list was divided, but by now it is my best guess. To make this assumption better, the list is shuffled after every step.
 *
 * After that, the script tries to remove a file from the list. It tests if the list breaks and if so, it
 * assumes that the file it removed belongs to the set of erroneous files.
 * This is done for all files, so, in the end removing one file leads to a working doc build.
